# Project Title

Data analysis of traffic information through routes

## Description

Learn how to use the google maps api with the Trafikverkets api and analyze the data. This lab shows how you can use several different APIs together to display new traffic information.

The task is to create a route function where you can enter a start destination and a destination and use google maps to create the optimal routes. Then you will get the camera data and using its coordinates create markers with google maps api and show the cameras on the map. The images will be available in the folders for this lab. The main problem that needs to be solved in this lab is how can we count how many cameras are on the route without manually counting by looking at the map?

## Installation
To be able to run this program on your own device you must have a google maps api key and a Trafikverket api key.

The google maps api key is completely free but you will need to create an account on google maps api. You just use your google account if you wish. 

1. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript - Maps JavaScript API(Documentation)

2. https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library?project=moonlit-aria-427508-b6 - Enable apis

3. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/add-google-map-wc-tut - Add a Google Map with Markers using HTML

Once you have created your account click on the get started button that should be on your screen once you have created your account. If it is not on your screen then click on the first link above. Then click on get started. After that in the header there will be a button called “Create New project”. Click on that and write the name of your project. After that on the left hand side in the menu click on keys and credentials. You will be in a new page then at the top click on create credentials and then create “api key”. Below you will be able to see the key and that will be the key that you will be using for this project.

Then click on the 2nd link. This link brings you to the enable apis website. Here you can add many different apis to your project that google offers. We will be using the “Maps Javascript API” and the “Directions API”. In the search bar search for those apis and click on them and then click enable. You will then be able to use these apis in your project to create maps.

Click on the 3rd link which brings you to the example code and documentation. Here test your api to make sure it works by copy pasting the example code in your code editor and replace the key in the example with your api key.

## Run Project:

When your api key works now you can copy past or clone the github project and just replace my key with your google maps api key and same with the Trafikverket API key. Then open the index.html on google and review the lab.
